# FloatingPointAddition

This is an early C programming assignment. I was given all of the files but had to implement all of the functions form iFloat.h into iFloat.c

This project focused heavily on bit manipulation to achieve the desired mathmatic operation.

#How to Compile
* with all of the files in a directory, type make
* ./testfloat will run the program
* ./testfloat followed by the function name will call that function

#Example Output
* input
./testFloat bin -3.625
* output
dec: -16280  hex: 0xFFFFC068  bin: 1100-0000-0110-1000
